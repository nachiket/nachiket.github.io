*When you come to a fork in the road, take it* - Yogi Berra <br>

*In the hyperconnected world, there is only "good" "better" and "best," and
managers and entrepreneurs everywhere now have greater access than ever to the
better and best people, robots and software everywhere. Obviously, this makes
it more vital than ever that we have schools elevating and inspiring more of
our young people into that better and best category, because even good might
not cut it anymore and average is definitely over.* - Thomas Friedman <br>
**[How Did the Robot End Up With My Job?](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/opinion/sunday/friedman-how-did-the-robot-end-up-with-my-job.html)**

*Modern Computer Architecture is the art and science of sculpting chips
without all the requisite tools; to run programs we cannot precisely
analyze; to resist errors we cannot accurately predict; all in such a
way that the society at large is given no reason to suspect the extent
of our ignorance.* <br>
**Adapted from Henry Petroski - [Success through Failure: The Paradox Of Design](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8132.html)**

*"Look," said Roark. "The famous flutings on the famous columns---what
are they there for? To hide the joints in wood---when columns were made
of wood, only these aren't, they're marble. The triglyphs, what are
they? Wood. Wooden beams, the way they had to be laid when people began
to build wooden shacks. Your Greeks took marble and they made copies of
their wooden structures out of it, because others had done it that way.
Then your masters of the Renaissance came along and made copies in
plaster of copies in marble of copies in wood. Now here we are making
copies in steel and concrete of copies in plaster of copies in marble
of copies in wood.  Why?* <br>
**Fountainhead, Ayn Rand - via Andre DeHon**

*"Always try to associate yourself with and learn as much as you can
from those who know more than you do, who do better than you, who see
more clearly than you."* <br>
**Eisenhower via David Brooks* [The Follower Problem](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/12/opinion/brooks-the-follower-problem.html)**

*"Take no man's word for it"*<br>
**Robert Hooke**

*"My arrogance, sir, extends just as far as my conscience demands"*<br>
**Eric Liddell - Chariots of Fire**

*"Why do we fall, sir? So that we can learn to pick ourselves up"*<br>
**Alfred - Batman Begins**

*Intellectuals, even more than the rest of us, like to believe that they reach
conclusions solely through study and reflection. But like the rest of us, they
sometimes choose their opinions to suit their friends rather than the other way
around.* <br>
**The Turning of an Atheist - NYTimes**

*For some reason not so well understood, mathematicians find it most difficult
to communicate their joys and frustrations, their insights and experiences to
the general public, indeed even to other fellow scientists! Perhaps, this is
due to the fact that mathematicians are trained to use very precise language,
and so find it hard to simplify and state something not entirely correct*<br>
**S Ramanan - TIFR Golden Jubilee Talk on Projective Geometry**

*"A crisis is an interesting thing,"  he said. In his view, a crisis is
a point in a story, a moment in a narrative, that presents an
opportunity for characters to think their way through a problem. A
catastrophe, on the other hand, is something different: it is one of
several possible outcomes that follow from a crisis.*<br>
**Jon Gertner - 'The Future is drying up' - New Yorker 2007**

*We've grown accustomed to the idea that with sufficient hard work and
dedication, there's no barrier to how fully we can both grasp reality
and confirm our understanding. But by gazing far into space we've
captured a handful of starkly informative photons, a cosmic telegram
billions of years in transit. And the message, echoing across the ages,
is clear. Sometimes nature guards her secrets with the unbreakable grip
of physical law. Sometimes the true nature of reality beckons from just
beyond the horizon.*<br>
**'Darkeness on the edge of the universe' - NYTimes 2011**

*Instead of designing beautiful data-structures and elegant algorithms, we're
looking up the EnterpriseFactoryBeanMaker class in the 3,456-page Bumper Tome
Of Horrible Stupid Classes (Special Grimoire Edition), because we can't
remember which of the arguments to the createEnterpriseBeanBuilderFactory()
method tells it to make the public static pure virtual destructor be a volatile
final abstract interface factory decorator.*<br>
**'Whatever happened to programming' - Reprog Blog**

*Reconquering peaks like K2 helps all of us, they say, and that is why
we should care. "It's a selfish act if it ends with you," said Chris
Warner, a seasoned American mountaineer who climbed K2 last year. "But
guys go back and are deeply humbled by the experience that they have
and they are much more capable of being husbands, brothers, people.
There is a part of the whole experience that is ultimately
metaphysical. Whenever you push the limits of ability, there is a
lesson in there for all of us."*<br>
**'Does Climbing Matter Anymore' - NYTimes **

*If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and
tastes like a duck, then, for all practical purposes, it is a duck*<br>
**Anon**
	
*Genius is by nature temperamental. Only the rarest of rare can temper
it to become predictable.*<br>
