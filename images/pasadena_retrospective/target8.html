<span class="textbg">Caltech Memories -- Back in 2004, IC-Lab was just graduating into an active, lively bunch of people. We always had several undergrads work with us in the summers. And, Andre usually took the group out for some fun. This time round, we went bowling. This being my first time, Andre was carefully explaining the scoring rules. Stephanie (left) was an undergrad student in our lab that summer. We wrote a paper together that was presented in Singapore a year later. (September 2004) </span><br> <span class="textsm"></span>
