<span class="textbg">Caltech Memories -- In Fall 2005, I went on every single Caltech-Y hike. Here, I went hiking in the Mt. Wilson wilderness area with my room-mates, Abhishek and Sukhada (I'm not in the photo, btw). I've spent one unforgettable year in their company! Abhishek is a brilliant graduate student in number-theory in the Caltech Math department while Sukhada is a Math undergrad about to start her graduate studies at Stanford (most probably) in Fall 2007. During this strenuous hike, we came across some hunters and heard several gun-shots (not necessarily in that order). No one was hurt, several were scared ;) (October 2005) </span><br> <span class="textsm"></span>
