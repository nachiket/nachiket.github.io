<span class="textbg">Caltech Memories -- It is always a pleasure when you see your childhood buddies. Sumier and I were great friends back in school. We were quiz-buddies and represented our school in several competitive events. Sumier was in LA while working on contract for IBM/Sony. He took time off his busy schedule and drove to Santa Barbara a day before I was to graduate. Sumier now lives in Atlanta and is an IBM employee.
