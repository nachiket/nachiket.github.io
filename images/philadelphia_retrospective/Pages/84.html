  A gorgeous view of the San Gabriel mountain from the Milikan library at Caltech... The San Gabriels were easily one fo the best things to happen to this region after Caltech. I had been on many a hike in those mountains... Later in 2010, a massive fire will burn down a significant portion of the hillside and along with it the memories of a scrubby landscape.. it will be several years before the hills restore...<p>
