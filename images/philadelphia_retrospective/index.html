We were invited to come visit UPenn to check out our new home.. While roaming around campus that day, we stumbled upon this sandy treat next to the bookstore!

     <a href="Pages/3.html"><img border="0" alt="" src="Thumbnails/3.jpg"></a><br><br>On the roadtrip, I entertained myself with my camera! I did eventually go on to lose this camera in a Philadelphia taxicab within hours or finishing the roadtrip... On the bright side, that made me upgrade to an SLR :P

     <a href="Pages/5.html"><img border="0" alt="" src="Thumbnails/5.jpg"></a><br><br>Promptly after arriving in Philadelphia, I got homesick and ran off to India to celebrate Diwali.... As a student, you can take a vacation whenever! :) This was quite possibly the biggest attraction of being a PhD student :)
