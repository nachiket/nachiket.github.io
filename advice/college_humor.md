A growing compendium of real events that have happened to me at NTU when
interacting with students. Lightly edited. -- *Nachiket*

**22nd August 2013**<br>

**Prof**: "Imagine you are describing this problem to your mother..."<br>
**Student**: "But my mom has a PhD in Electrical Engineering and understands this problem better than me..."<br>

**Prof**: *(explaining saliency computation)* "...in a sea of students sitting in the lab, where are my eyes most likely to focus..."<br>
**Student**: "...the female students..."<br>

**Student**: *(via email)* "... P.S. Do you happen to know Dr. Sheldon Cooper from Caltech?" <br>

**Student**: *(via email)* "... P.S. Bazinga" <br> 

**Student**: *(walks into office)* "Is this where the tea ceremony is going to be?" <br>

**31st July 2014** <br>
Convocation Day 2014 - student walks into my office looking for a tie to wear
to the ceremony. I don't have one so cannot really help him. He seems desperate
and lost. Upon prodding him, he reveals his concern that maybe he won't get his
degree without a tie?! I now carry a tie in my drawer to spare prospective
graduates any blushes :).
