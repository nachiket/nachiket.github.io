# Abstract (200 words)

- Crisp, quantitative Claim of what you're planning to show
	- e.g. We can make SPICE run 10 times faster using cheap off-the-shelf hardware (**correct**) 
	- e.g. SPICE runs faster when using our ideas (**wrong**)

# Retro-Perspective (1/2 page)

<font color="red"> Where do you think you are now </font>
- How do you expect your advisor to help you out?
<font color="red"> Describe your working relationship with your advisor </font>
- What is the one thing you truly love about computer engineering? Feel free to describe a topic outside the scope of the FYP.
<font color="red"> What new concepts/ideas/skills did you learn. What do you **still** want to learn?</font>

# Planning (2 pages)

- Include your term calendar. The advisor should have an idea of how loaded you are during the semester and how much effort/work can you put in. It is ok to attach just a JPG or screenshot of your StudentLink calendar.
- Also attach a rough sketch of your proposed plan. Try to use a simple Table format organized by month.
- Attach the plan of actual execution. (**COMPARE WITH ORIGINAL PLAN**) and comment on the disparity. What did you learn? 

# Resources (1/2 page)

- What hardware/software infrastructure do you need for your project?
- Are you comfortable with these platforms? How will you learn about these new platforms?
<font color="red"> Any new requirements emerged over the year? </font>

# Reading List (1 pages)

- Talk to your advisor to get a reading list. By the end of the project, each of the suggested references should become short paragraphs of description.
