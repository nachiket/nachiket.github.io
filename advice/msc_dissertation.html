At the same time, you need to tell a <strong>good story</strong>. You need to connect with your reader at several levels.</td>

<h1 id="advice">Advice</h1>
<ul>
<li>Use active voice.
<ul>
<li>e.g. We show how to speedup computations (<strong>correct</strong>)</li>
<li>e.g. It is shown that speedup can be achieved.. (<strong>wrong</strong>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Good engineering students should <em>quantify</em> all aspects of their design. Vague claims &quot;this is good, this is bad&quot; will not be appreciated.</p></li>
<li><p>Use examples to explain difficult concepts. Simply writing equations or program pseudo-code is <em>not</em> enough. Try to convey the intuition behind the problem you are solving.</p></li>
<li><p>Use Markdown+Pandoc on Ubuntu/MacOSX to generate your preliminary reports. Eventually you will have to switch to Latex.</p></li>
<li><p>State <strong>novelty</strong> of the MSc project. I expect MSc reports to be novel in some way. They cannot simply be engineering efforts.</p></li>
<li><p>Become familiar with <strong>gnuplot</strong> or other visualization tools to help you better support your plotting needs. I will <em>NOT</em> accept Excel-based plots.</p></li>
<li><p>Think about designing good experiments. It is not sufficient to merely get your idea working. It is not a binary system of evaluation - works vs does not work. In fact, there is a lot you can learn even if your ideas do not work. How well does your system perform? What are its operating limits/weaknesses? Can it be improved and by how much?</p></li>
<li><p>Tell a good story. Ultimately, we all like to listen to a carefully constructed narrative. Make it interesting for everyone.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>The MSc disseration should be modeled like a research paper with the following breakdown of section. This is recommended for double-column, double-sided A4 pages with 10-point font. Read a few technical papers first to get a hang of the language/tone expected and the type of report you will be expected to write.</p>
<h1 id="abstract-1-page">Abstract (1 page)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Crisp, quantitative Claim of what you have achieved (quantitative=numerical statement)
<ul>
<li>e.g. We can make SPICE run 10 times faster using cheap off-the-shelf hardware (<strong>correct</strong>)</li>
<li>e.g. SPICE runs faster when using our ideas (<strong>wrong</strong>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Explain the idea behind your project effort. Why does your idea work (or not?).</p></li>
<li><p>Elaborate the idea with <em>insightful</em> comments about the instinct behind the idea.</p></li>
<li><p>If this is an unexpected result, say what the typical expectation is...</p></li>
<li><p>How does this advance the state-of-the-art in the field?</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Gentle introduction of the subject under discussion. Writing introductions is an art. Try to think of how a popular science article is written. It should almost be something that your mom can read and understand.</p></li>
<li><p>A nice iconic picture that captures your problem/system would be perfect here. This may or may be possible in your project. This will help the reader associate your report with this first visual impression.</p></li>
<li><p>At the end, summarize a list of key claims/deliverables of the report.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="background-2-pages">Background (2 pages)</h1>
<ul>
<li>What new knowledge did you need to learn to implement your project? These should strictly be scientific/technical ideas and not really based on <em>personal experience</em></li>
<li>e.g. I had to learn Linux (<strong>wrong</strong>)
<ul>
<li>e.g. If you friend from a different specialization were to read your report, what key concepts from your area should he know. Think of that are write down self-contained high-level summaries of these concepts. (<strong>correct</strong>)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="literature-review-1-page">Literature review (1 page)</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>No scientific scholarly work is complete without context. It is important that you talk to your advisor to get a broader perspective of the area. Your work will sound a lot more intelligent when you show that you have made an effort to highlight the contrast between your report and other efforts.</p></li>
<li><p>A tabular taxonomy/classification of existing ideas can be helpful. Again shows that you are a systematic person who knows how to visually place his work in the world.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="idea-3-4-pages">Idea (3-4 pages)</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>This is all up to you. Good students distinguish themselves from others by using examples to walk a reader thought the mechanics of the internals of the project.</p></li>
<li><p>Meaningless laborious complex details do not impress anyone. Think hard about what details to leave out. Just because you spent a lot of time being stuck at a particular step of the problem does not mean you have to devote a proportional amount of space in text.</p></li>
<li><p>Make it interesting to read. Examiners have to read dozens of reports. Cute analogies, pretty pictures, good examples will stand out and be remembered. Boring details and hard-to-understand descriptions will be forgotten.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="experiments-5-6-pages">Experiments (5-6 pages)</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Most students ignore this component. They stop at the &quot;it is working&quot; phase. I really only start to evaluate the student project when I start seeing numbers and quantification of the project.</p></li>
<li><p>Design good experiments. Put your scientist hats on and try to think of how you can show off your achievements.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn to use plotting/graphing tools. Use labels and text that is actually visible properly. Examiners do not carry around magnifying glasses on a typical workday.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide a head-to-head comparison with a competing system if it exists. This will further reaffirm the quality and scholarly nature of your work.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide an in-depth discussion of the key ideas that emerge after looking at the data.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusions-1-page">Conclusions (1 page)</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Restate the quantitative claim from the abstract. Tell the examiner what you have already told him before (repeat for clarity).</p></li>
<li><p>DO NOT INTRODUCE A NEW IDEA IN THE CONCLUSIONS. All concepts should have been covered earlier.</p></li>
<li><p>Conclusions are only a place to collate the 'aha' moments you had when writing the report or conducting your experiments.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="planning-1-page">Planning (1 page)</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>How does your final execution compare to the actual initial plan sketch?</p></li>
<li><p>What new skills did you learn during the MSc project? Did you have to learn something that you never thought you would have to/be able to learn?</p></li>
<li><p>What was your working relationship with your advisor? Did you expect things to be different and in what way?</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="future-work-1-page">Future Work (1 page)</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>No project is complete without a forward direction. Do not be afraid to think of the weaknesses of your project.</p></li>
<li><p>Think about what you did not have time to complete but your advisor wanted to see completed.</p></li>
</ul>
