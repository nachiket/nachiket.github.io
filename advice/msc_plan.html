<p>The MSc disseration should be modeled like a research paper with the following breakdown of section.</p>
<h1 id="abstract-1-page">Abstract (1 page)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Crisp, quantitative Claim of what you have achieved (quantitative=numerical statement)
<ul>
<li>e.g. We can make SPICE run 10 times faster using cheap off-the-shelf hardware (<strong>correct</strong>)</li>
<li>e.g. SPICE runs faster when using our ideas (<strong>wrong</strong>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Explain the idea behind your project effort in the manner you understand so far...</p></li>
<li><p>How does this advance the state-of-the-art in the field?</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="perspective-1-page">Perspective (1 page)</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>What do you want to learn from this project? What do you find interesting?</p></li>
<li><p>How do you expect your advisor to help you out? How will you work with your advisor?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the one thing you truly love about computer engineering? Feel free to describe a topic outside the scope of the MSc report.</p></li>
<li><p>Briefly describe your programming/development and professional skills if any. In a few sentences describe the most interesting technical programming-based project you have worked on.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="planning-2-pages">Planning (2 pages)</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Include your term calendar. The advisor should have an idea of how loaded you are during the semester and how much effort/work can you put in. It is ok to attach just a JPG or screenshot of your StudentLink calendar.</p></li>
<li><p>Also attach a rough sketch of your proposed plan. Try to use a simple Table format organized by month.</p></li>
<li>When you are actually done, attach another plan of actual execution.
<ul>
<li>This should hopefully teach you to plan your projects better for the future.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Feel free to fill the following template directly in Markdown.</p></li>
</ul>
