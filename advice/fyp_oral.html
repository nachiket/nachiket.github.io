<h1 id="advice">Advice</h1>
<ul>
<li>Use the bare-bones/vanilla Powerpoint template
<ul>
<li>Students spend too much time changing fonts, font colors, setting up animations and poorly distributing presentation elements.</li>
<li>You should focus on the key message and not the avoidable, poorly-orchestrated theatrics.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>An FYP oral should be structured to be concise
<ul>
<li>A 15-minute oral should have roughly 15 slides</li>
<li>Spend a minute on each slide</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Slide text should <font color="red">NOT</font> be complete sentences -- but merely words and phrases
<ul>
<li>Coach yourself to use the bullets in the slides as seed for talking points</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use quantitative evidence in the presentation
<ul>
<li>In an engineering-oriented presentation, technical arguments should be made with evidence</li>
<li>Always show numbers, measurements, to make a point</li>
<li>Quantify, quantify, quantify</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use simple examples
<ul>
<li>It is highly unlikely that the examiner has the time/attention span to deeply understand your core problem</li>
<li>Avoid conveying incorrect message by constructing too simplistic an example
<ul>
<li>The example should be selected to identify the challenges you have faced/solved</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use Powerpoint objects directly when drawing plots or diagrams
<ul>
<li>Sloppy students will simply copy-paste plots from report -- these will be lower resolution and inappropriate for a large screen</li>
<li>Do not just show data tables... Visualizations of data in tables are more easily comprehensible.</li>
<li>Lead your audience through the visuals
<ul>
<li>What question does this plot answer?</li>
<li>What is interesting about this plot?</li>
<li>Define the axes and explain what part of the plot represents good results and what part is bad..</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Practice once or twice
<ul>
<li>I've seen presentations go haywire for frivolous reasons</li>
<li>Practice at least once so you have feedback (from your own judgment or from a friend) and adjust accordingly</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Face the examiners (audience)
<ul>
<li>If you're lost on your slide with your back to the examiners, we won't hear you clearly</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Display confidence and poise
<ul>
<li>I don't particularly care about how you dress -- the FYP oral is not a judgment on your dressing skills
<ul>
<li><em>Caveat</em>: It doesn't hurt to be presentable (just don't overdo it)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Impress us with your words and wit</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a recommended structure for organizing a good FYP presentation. Stick to the default Powerpoint template and font sizes and layout -- do not waste time trying to be cute.</p>
<h1 id="problem-1-slide">Problem (1 slide)</h1>
<ul>
<li>What problem are you solving? What is your <strong>claim</strong>?
<ul>
<li>Answer this directly upfront in a concise single sentence</li>
<li>Use additional/separate slides (if needed) to <em>explain</em> the claim
<ul>
<li>Remember, a claim can be proved or disproved so choose justly</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="introduction-2-3-slides">Introduction (2-3 slides)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Use an example to motivate the challenge in the FYP project.
<ul>
<li>Feel free to use/draw pictures when illustrating the properties of the problem challenge</li>
<li>Build intuition behind what is going on..</li>
<li>Maybe OK to show a sneak preview of what the <em>solved</em> final result looks like
<ul>
<li>Just show a glimpse to keep us excited</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="idea-3-4-slides">Idea (3-4 slides)</h1>
<ul>
<li>What are the key building blocks of your system or idea?
<ul>
<li>Any engineering system has moving parts that must work together in tandem to demonstrate a final solution</li>
<li>What are inputs and outputs of such a system and what properties are expected to be enforced</li>
<li>Are there constraints to be considered when searching for the solution to your problem?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reuse the example to show how you solve the identified problem
<ul>
<li>The beauty of simple examples is they are easy to solve on a piece of paper
<ul>
<li>Hence, ideal for slide-based communication</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Imagine you are explaining your FYP project to your classmate
<ul>
<li>Instinctively, you will resort to examples and be all animated and excited</li>
<li>Talk to me like you are talking to a friend. I want to feel the excitement you feel for your project.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="experiment-design-1-2-slides">Experiment Design (1-2 slides)</h1>
<ul>
<li>What aspects of your system did you test? How did you setup the test?</li>
<li>How did you make sure your results are trustworthy?</li>
<li>What key engineering questions do these tests answer?
<ul>
<li>These may be best answered in consultation with your supervisor</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="results-3-4-slides">Results (3-4 slides)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Show pretty graphs and plots
<ul>
<li>A trick I use extensively is incremental reveal of results for a 2D plot...</li>
<li>Show the axes-only first... Then show one curve... Then animate the second curve and so on...</li>
<li>This strategy keeps visual clutter to a minimum and as an audience I know what to focus on
<ul>
<li><em>Caution</em>: This is the only place where &quot;Appear&quot; animation in Powerpoint is OK. Animation in general is a poor way to communicate an idea. You're talking to a mostly-technical audience and you do not need to treat us like kids addicted to moving objects.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusions-1-slide">Conclusions (1 slide)</h1>
<ul>
<li>What claims you made at the start did your FYP project achieve?
<ul>
<li>Without quantifiable outcomes, your project is not an engineering project.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Were you surprised by any roadblock or did everything go smoothly?</li>
<li>Review the technical skills you learned..</li>
</ul>
