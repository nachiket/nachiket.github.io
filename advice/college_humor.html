<p><strong>Prof</strong>: &quot;Imagine you are describing this problem to your mother...&quot;<br> <strong>Student</strong>: &quot;But my mom has a PhD in Electrical Engineering and understands this problem better than me...&quot;<br></p>
<p><strong>Prof</strong>: <em>(explaining saliency computation)</em> &quot;...in a sea of students sitting in the lab, where are my eyes most likely to focus...&quot;<br> <strong>Student</strong>: &quot;...the female students...&quot;<br></p>
<p><strong>Student</strong>: <em>(via email)</em> &quot;... P.S. Do you happen to know Dr. Sheldon Cooper from Caltech?&quot; <br></p>
<p><strong>Student</strong>: <em>(via email)</em> &quot;... P.S. Bazinga&quot; <br></p>
<p><strong>Student</strong>: <em>(walks into office)</em> &quot;Is this where the tea ceremony is going to be?&quot; <br></p>

<p><strong>18th March 2014</strong> <br> <strong>Student Email Subject</strong> &quot;¯(°_o)/¯&quot; <strong>Context</strong>: I'm throwing up my hands in despair. My experiment does not work!</p>

<p><strong>31st July 2014</strong> <br> Convocation Day 2014 - student walks into my office looking for a tie to wear to the ceremony. I don't have one so cannot really help him. He seems desperate and lost. Upon prodding him, he reveals his concern that maybe he won't get his degree without a tie?! I now carry a tie in my drawer to spare prospective graduates any blushes :).</p>

<p><strong>16th January 2015</strong> <br> After a particularaly grueling MSc final exam for ES6152, my students posted this image on the class wiki.<br> <img src="es6152_2014.jpg" title="Bean Bean Bean.." alt="Mr. Bean" /> <br></p>
