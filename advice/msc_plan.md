**Grading Policy** <br>

| | | |
|:--|:--|:--|
|20% | Regular 1:1 meetings | The process of conducting yourself through the MSc is as important as the final product. You will be expected to attend all 1:1 weekly meetings. Exceptions only with MCs. |
|10% | Draft plan | A good engineer knows how to provision the most important resource: **time**, for his project. I will expect at least a rough plan outline that we revise as we execute the project. | 
|20% | Regular 15-minute group presentations (once a month) | A good engineer is also a good oral communicator. I will expect short 15-minute presentations to my research group once a month. Ultimately, I want you to become confident speakers and great communicators.. |
|50% | Final report | Technical report writing is very different from writing an exam. In industry, you will be expected to be precise with your specifications and communications. At the same time, you need to tell a **good story**. You need to connect with your reader at several levels. |

The MSc disseration should be modeled like a research paper with the following
breakdown of section. 

# Abstract (1 page)

- Crisp, quantitative Claim of what you have achieved (quantitative=numerical
  statement)
	- e.g. We can make SPICE run 10 times faster using cheap off-the-shelf
	  hardware (**correct**)
	- e.g. SPICE runs faster when using our ideas (**wrong**)

- Explain the idea behind your project effort in the manner you understand so far...

- How does this advance the state-of-the-art in the field?

# Perspective (1 page) 

- What do you want to learn from this project? What do you find interesting?

- How do you expect your advisor to help you out? How will you work with your advisor?

- What is the one thing you truly love about computer engineering? Feel free to
  describe a topic outside the scope of the MSc report.

- Briefly describe your programming/development and professional skills if any.
  In a few sentences describe the most interesting technical programming-based
  project you have worked on.

# Planning (2 pages)

- Include your term calendar. The advisor should have an idea of how loaded you
  are during the semester and how much effort/work can you put in. It is ok to
  attach just a JPG or screenshot of your StudentLink calendar.

- Also attach a rough sketch of your proposed plan. Try to use a simple Table
  format organized by month.

- When you are actually done, attach another plan of actual execution. 
	- This should hopefully teach you to plan your projects better for the
	  future.

- Feel free to fill the following template directly in Markdown.

| | |
|:--|:--|
| Month 1 | Foraging for berries and fruit |
| Month 2 | Building hut for shelter against rain... |
| Month 12 | Get rescued from island |


# Resources (1/2 page)

- What hardware/software infrastructure do you need for your project?
- Are you comfortable with these platforms? How will you learn about these new
  platforms?

# Reading List (1 page)

- Talk to your advisor to get a reading list. By the end of the project, each
  of the suggested references should become short paragraphs of description.
