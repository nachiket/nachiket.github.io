# Advice 
- Use the bare-bones/vanilla Powerpoint template
	- Students spend too much time changing fonts, font colors, setting up animations and poorly distributing presentation elements.
	- You should focus on the key message and not the avoidable, poorly-orchestrated theatrics.

- An FYP oral should be structured to be concise 
	- A 15-minute oral should have roughly 15 slides
	- Spend a minute on each slide

- Slide text should <font color="red">NOT</font> be complete sentences -- but merely words and phrases
	- Coach yourself to use the bullets in the slides as seed for talking points

- Use quantitative evidence in the presentation
	- In an engineering-oriented presentation, technical arguments should be made with evidence
	- Always show numbers, measurements, to make a point
	- Quantify, quantify, quantify

- Use simple examples
	- It is highly unlikely that the examiner has the time/attention span to deeply understand your core problem 
	- Avoid conveying incorrect message by constructing too simplistic an example
		- The example should be selected to identify the challenges you have faced/solved

- Use Powerpoint objects directly when drawing plots or diagrams
	- Sloppy students will simply copy-paste plots from report -- these will be lower resolution and inappropriate for a large screen
	- Do not just show data tables... Visualizations of data in tables are more easily comprehensible.
	- Lead your audience through the visuals
		- What question does this plot answer?
		- What is interesting about this plot?
		- Define the axes and explain what part of the plot represents good results and what part is bad..

- Practice once or twice
	- I've seen presentations go haywire for frivolous reasons
	- Practice at least once so you have feedback (from your own judgment or from a friend) and adjust accordingly

- Face the examiners (audience)
	- If you're lost on your slide with your back to the examiners, we won't hear you clearly

- Display confidence and poise
	- I don't particularly care about how you dress -- the FYP oral is not a judgment on your dressing skills
		- *Caveat*: It doesn't hurt to be presentable (just don't overdo it)
	- Impress us with your words and wit

Here is a recommended structure for organizing a good FYP presentation. Stick to the default Powerpoint template and font sizes and layout -- do not waste time trying to be cute.

# Problem (1 slide)
- What problem are you solving? What is your **claim**?
	- Answer this directly upfront in a concise single sentence
	- Use additional/separate slides (if needed) to *explain* the claim
		- Remember, a claim can be proved or disproved so choose justly

# Introduction (2-3 slides)
- Use an example to motivate the challenge in the FYP project.
	- Feel free to use/draw pictures when illustrating the properties of the problem challenge
	- Build intuition behind what is going on..
	- Maybe OK to show a sneak preview of what the *solved* final result looks like 
		- Just show a glimpse to keep us excited

# Idea (3-4 slides)
- What are the key building blocks of your system or idea?
	- Any engineering system has moving parts that must work together in tandem to demonstrate a final solution
	- What are inputs and outputs of such a system and what properties are exepcted to be enforeced 
	- Are there constraints to be considered when searching for the solution to your problem?
- Reuse the example to show how you solve the identified problem
	- The beauty of simple examples is they are easy to solve on a piece of paper
		- Hence, ideal for slide-based communication
	- Imagine you are explaining your FYP project to your classmate 
		- Instinctively, you will resort to examples and be all animated and excited
		- Talk to me like you are talking to a friend. I want to feel the excitement you feel for your project.

# Experiment Design (1-2 slides)
- What aspects of your system did you test? How did you setup the test?
- How did you make sure your results are trustworthy?
- What key engineering questions do these tests answer?
	- These may be best answered in consultation with your supervisor

# Results (3-4 slides)
- Show pretty graphs and plots
	- A trick I use extensively is incremental reveal of results for a 2D plot...
	- Show the axes-only first... Then show one curve... Then animate the second curve and so on...
	- This strategy keeps visual clutter to a minimum and as an audience I know what to focus on
		- *Caution*: This is the only place where "Appear" animation in Powerpoint is OK. Animation in general is a poor way to communicate an idea. You're talking to a mostly-technical audience and you do not need to treat us like kids addicted to moving objects.

# Conclusions (1 slide)
- What claims you made at the start did your FYP project achieve?
	- Without quantifiable outcomes, your project is not an engineering project.
- Were you surprised by any roadblock or did everything go smoothly?
- Review the technical skills you learned..
