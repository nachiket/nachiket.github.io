<section>
<p>In the Waterloo Configurable Architectures Group (WatCAG), we are broadly interested in understanding and exploiting the potential of spatial parallelism for implementing computation using reconfigurable architectures such as FPGAs. Reconfigurable computing has now come of age with the multi-billion dollar acquisition of Altera by Intel, and rapid adoption of FPGAs in the cloud at Amazon, Huawei, Baidu, Alibaba among other cloud providers. With the rising computing demands of machine learning workloads coupled with the pending demise of Moore's Law, there has never been a more exciting time to work in this field than today.</p>
<p>In the WatCAG group, we ask the following big questions: - What might reconfigurable computing architectures of the future look like, and how will be program them? - What computing problems are reconfigurable architectures useful for, and how do we seamlessly integrate them in mainstream computing systems (cloud, embedded)? - Can we rethink the programming abstractions for reconfigurable hardware by emphasizing communication and energy awareness at different levels in the compilation stack?</p>
Specifically, the group looks at a combination of <em>Architecture</em>, <em>Compilation</em>, and <em>Application</em> domains to work towards answering these questions.
