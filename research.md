<section>
In the Waterloo Configurable Architectures Group (WatCAG), we are broadly
interested in understanding and exploiting the potential of spatial
parallelism for implementing computation using reconfigurable architectures
such as FPGAs.  Reconfigurable computing has now come of age with the
multi-billion dollar acquisition of Altera by Intel, and rapid adoption of
FPGAs in the cloud at Amazon, Huawei, Baidu, Alibaba among other cloud
providers. With the rising computing demands of machine learning workloads
coupled with the pending demise of Moore's Law, there has never been a more
exciting time to work in this field than today.

In the WatCAG group, we ask the following big questions:
- What might reconfigurable computing architectures of the future look like, and how will be program them?
- What computing problems are reconfigurable architectures useful for, and how do we seamlessly integrate them in mainstream computing systems (cloud, embedded)?
- Can we rethink the programming abstractions for reconfigurable hardware by emphasizing communication and energy awareness at different levels in the compilation stack?

Specifically, the group looks at a combination of *Architecture*, *Compilation*, and *Application* domains to work towards answering these questions.

##Architecture

The group has investigated the design and engineering of token dataflow
overlays, vector processor characterization, embedded system evaluation,
real-time systems, and FPGA-specific network-on-chip architectures for
use in accelerators.

##Applications

We are excited about novel uses of FPGAs in emerging application scenarios in the cloud as well as embedded contexts. The group has published papers in machine learning,

##Compilation

The group has developed various automation tools, compiler passes, and
frameworks for use with FPGAs. In particular, we have tools to perform
precision analysis, performance tuning, machine-learning driven FPGA
compilation, among other solutions.
